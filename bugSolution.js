Several solutions exist depending on the root cause.  Common approaches include:

1. **Simplifying the project structure:**  Try to organize your project in a more standard Expo project layout. This often resolves issues.
2. **Verifying dependencies:**  Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed in `package.json` and that you have the correct versions. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to resolve any missing dependencies.
3. **Cleaning the cache:**  Try running `expo prebuild --clean` or `expo start --clear` to remove cached files that might be conflicting.
4. **Checking for conflicting dependencies:** Look for version conflicts or incompatible dependencies. Use tools such as `npm-check` to identify such conflicts.
5. **Manually specifying paths:**  In some instances, explicitly specifying paths to assets or modules might be necessary to help Expo correctly locate them.
6. **Creating a new project:**  As a last resort, create a new Expo project and migrate your code piece by piece to identify the problematic files or configurations.

**Example (bugSolution.js):**
```javascript
// Simplified project structure to resolve the issue
export default function App(){
  // ... your app code
}
```
